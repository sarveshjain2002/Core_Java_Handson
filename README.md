📚 Welcome to Core Java Hands-on Practice! 🖥️
Get ready to dive deep into the world of Java programming with our comprehensive four-part hands-on practice series. 🌟

Part 1: Control Flow Statements and Variables
In this section, we'll explore the fundamentals of control flow statements, including loops and conditional statements, to control the flow of your Java programs. Additionally, we'll delve into the world of variables, understanding their types and how to use them effectively in your code.

Part 2: Classes, Objects, and More
Part 2 takes you into the heart of Java programming. We'll cover classes and objects, essential building blocks for creating structured programs. You'll learn about method overloading, constructors (both default and parameterized), and the power of the this keyword. Dive into topics like garbage collection and finalization while mastering local instance and static variables.

Part 3: Inheritance, Interfaces, and Abstraction
Building on your Java knowledge, Part 3 delves into advanced concepts. Understand the intricacies of inheritance, explore the world of interfaces, and discover the art of method overriding. We'll also introduce you to aggregation, the super keyword, and the importance of finalizing your classes with the final keyword. Plus, learn about abstract classes and methods for creating flexible and modular code.

Part 4: Exception Handling
In the final part of our Java hands-on practice, we tackle exception handling. Dive deep into the world of exceptions, understanding the difference between checked and unchecked exceptions. Learn how to handle errors gracefully in your Java programs, ensuring your applications run smoothly even when unexpected issues arise.
